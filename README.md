## Data Structures Challenge in Python

### Challenge Description
Implement a class `Stack` that represents a stack data structure in Python. This challenge focuses on working with data structures.

### Setup and Execution
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- Run tests using `python -m unittest test_main.py`.
- Implement your solution in `main.py`.

### Task
- Your `Stack` class should include the following methods:
  - `push(item)`: Add an item to the top of the stack.
  - `pop()`: Remove and return the top item from the stack. If the stack is empty, return None.
  - `peek()`: Return the value of the top item without removing it from the stack. If the stack is empty, return None.
  - `is_empty()`: Return True if the stack is empty, False otherwise.
